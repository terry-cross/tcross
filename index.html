            <p>
              Looking back on my experience in the work force since
              graduating<br />
              from college I see where I have had 2 careers, and I am
              currently<br />
              pursuing a third. All three have involved
              <em>developing technologies</em><br />
              and have conditioned me to keep a steady eye on what lies ahead<br />
              in the future.

            <h2>Video Production Technician</h2>

            
              When I began working in television broadcasting<br />
              <strong>Sony</strong> released <em>the chip camera</em> which soon
              replaced tube cameras.<br />
              Changes in the industry came regularly after that with changes<br />
              in tape formats and recording equipment, character generators,<br />
              live remotes and satellite transmissions,<br />
              everything was being moved to a <em>digital platform</em>.<br />
              I have developed a basic rule for adapting to changes:<br />
              <strong
                ><em
                  >Learn how things are organized, and learn where to look</em
                ></strong
              >.<br />
              This rule has served me working as a Master Control Operator,<br />
              as a hospital AV technician, and as TV producer director.
            </p>
            <h2>CTE Instructor</h2>
            <p>
              What I learned from working in television,<br />
              I was able to relate to high school students because my
              background<br />
              afforded me the role of being a "Jack of All Trades."<br />
              I could teach students about shooting video and recording audio
              well,<br />
              and how to conduct interviews in front of the camera. <br />Behind
              the scene skills of writing and directing<br />
              and producing allowed me to offer<br />
              a broad array of training to large classes.<br />The technical
              advances in the TV film industry <br />were occuring rapidly and
              made it challenging<br />
              for high school programs to offer training<br />
              on up to date equipment. While they may not<br />
              have received training on the latest industry tech,<br />
              I was able to offer my students training in film anaylysis.
              <br />As a career technical education instructor<br />
              in the Arts Media Entertainment sector. <br />I stressed
              professionalism to students, reminding them,<br /><strong
                ><em
                  >"The only difference between an amatuer and a
                  professional</em
                ></strong
              ><br />
              <strong
                ><em
                  >is that a professional knows how to trouble shoot."</em
                ></strong
              >
            </p>
            <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
            <p>
              Working with computers became a more integral part <br />of
              working in the field of video productions.<br />
              Becoming familiar with computer applications,<br />
              like <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>, became a necessity for
              operating<br />
              character graphics in video productions.<br />
              I made a transition from teaching video productions<br />
              to teaching graphic design as a <em>CTE Instructor</em><br />
              after attending a Digital Learning Academy.<br />
              At the Academy I studied
              <strong
                >Adobe Photoshop,<br />
                Illustrator, and InDesign</strong
              >, along with some<br />
              <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, and
              <em>3D Printing</em>.<br />Getting a better handle on coding
              would<br />
              definitely help me develop a stronger curriculum<br />
              for my graphic design students. However, my son,<br />
              who graduated from Loyola Marymount,<br />
              was able to land his first job as a software engineer<br />
              earning 6 figures.This has brought me<br />
              to a new level of thinking in career choices. <br />The evolution
              of technology has always reminded me<br />
              to keep learning in order to remain relevant. <br />With online
              learning becoming the new norm<br />
              and my teaching career on hold with the Corona Virus,<br />
              software engineering at Kenzie Academy<br />
              may be the avenue to travel into a thrid career.
