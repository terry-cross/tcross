# Kenzie Academy Basic Portfolio

Remember the assessment: 'Basic Portfolio' where we created a web page demonstrating headers, paragraphs, and anchor tags ( `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<a href="...">`)?
It looked something like this: https://ka-basic-profile.glitch.me/
Well today we want you to add more content to that page, making use of all the new markup you have learned. 
Additionally, you will be moving this code into Github repository for grading.

Open up the assignment and clone it to your computer.
Then copy the content from your previous work into the `index.html` file.

Please use the following features:

- Ordered and unordered lists
- Bold and italic text
- Summary and details tags
- Separating content using divisions (divs), sections, and horizontal rules
- Configuring the title of the page or tab
- Embedding images
- Showing one or more special characters using HTML Entities

All of the items above are required, but feel free to use other tags or introduce rudimentary styling if you like!
